This 'spagetty' project was created for test tusk in SolarLab company to test my Java skills. Its main goals are use of simplest libraries with low docs and language abilities to replace popular frameworks in workflow. This code has few depedencies compared anower way created. Also its my first complex webapp, so I can say Im excited by CSS and HTML fst try. It isnt SPA app, but have very simple queries to backend, so adding namely few string in JS, like async await fetch, may rebuild it to JSON-SPA webpp. Mb later. =)
